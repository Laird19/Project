            <p>
                Located on the picturesque coast of York Beach, Maine, Laird's Lobsters has been a cornerstone of the local seafood scene since 1920. Founded by Laird Masterson Sr., our restaurant began as a humble shack serving fresh lobster to the community. Over the decades, we've grown into a celebrated full-service restaurant known for exceptional seafood, sustainable practices, and a commitment to our local community.
            </p>
            <p>
                We proudly honor our founder's legacy by combining over a century of tradition with modern culinary innovation to create unforgettable dining experiences.
