                My name is Laird Masterson, and I was born and raised in a small beach town in Maine by my two great parents. 
                Growing up, I had the privilege of sharing my childhood with two older brothers. I spent most of my youth playing hockey 
                and lacrosse, which taught me teamwork, discipline, and leadership. Additionally, I have a deep interest in business 
                management, which has driven my academic pursuits and personal growth.

            <p>
                During high school, I enjoyed playing sports such as lacrosse and hockey, which helped me build valuable skills in teamwork and resilience. Outside of sports, I developed a love for cooking, often preparing meals and dinners for my family. Skiing and spending quality time with friends have always been a part of my recreational activities. One of my greatest passions is surfingâ€”a sport that has a deep personal connection for me as I was named after the legendary surfer Laird Hamilton.
