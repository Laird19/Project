                My name is Laird Masterson, I was born and raised in a small beach town in Maine by my two great parents George and Nicole. 
                Growing up, I had the privilege of sharing my childhood with two older brothers Wil and Theo. I spent most of my youth playing hockey 
                and lacrosse, which taught me many lessons I keep with me today. Additionally, I have a deep interest in business, 
                which has driven my academic pursuits and personal growth.
