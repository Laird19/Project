                My name is Laird Masterson, and I was born and raised in a small beach town in Maine by my two great parents. 
                Growing up, I had the privilege of sharing my childhood with two older brothers. I spent most of my youth playing hockey 
                and lacrosse, which taught me teamwork, discipline, and leadership.

                I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Management at the University of New Hampshire. 
                I am passionate about learning how businesses operate and how I can thrive in a economic world.
