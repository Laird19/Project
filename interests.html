            <p>
                During high school, I enjoyed playing sports such as lacrosse and hockey, which helped me build valuable skills in teamwork and resilience. Outside of sports, I developed a love for cooking, often preparing meals and dinners for my family. Skiing and spending quality time with friends have always been a part of my recreational activities. One of my greatest passions is surfingâ€”a sport that has a deep personal connection for me as I was named after the legendary surfer Laird Hamilton.
